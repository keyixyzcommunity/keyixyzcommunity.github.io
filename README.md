# keyixyzcommunity.github.io
Public static site landing page for keyi.xyz, and the machinery for CICD 'github actions' for publishing to 'github pages'


Basic elements plan for now:
Banner, ![banner-keyi](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/334b45cf-0499-4490-9639-5e17de2ff4f7)

question about dreams,   https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1cr90dbCzyFPol5qdpdNulhfOh9dnSI2WWKYVPj0hDj0

coin CA, 9oQsNyT1vgNSqxfkec3FjNnQdHZpcvT5dHsZtdarpump

links to social. t.me/keyixyz and https://x.com/keyixyz






Then we can have it augmented with various tools that we find useful as a community. 
It can become a weekly goal to update the ecosystem with one useful thing (in line with the weekly goals we discussed on spaces).




Plan moving forward: Add or update 1 element per week
